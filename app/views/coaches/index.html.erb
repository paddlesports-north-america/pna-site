      <h2>Understanding British Canoeing<br />Coaching Awards</h2>
      <p>The old (BCU) and current coaching systems are significantly different, making direct comparison highly problematic. Put simply, the current system demands a much higher and broader level of personal and coaching skill and maintains more stringent quality control. The old BCU coaching system was the accepted international gold standard, and is still copied as the basis of most other systems of paddlesport coach/instructor certification. The current system moves coach education and certification to an elevated level. Drawing from and contributing to developments in all areas of sports science, as well as input from top level coaches, paddlers and athletes, the current British Canoeing system is the new gold standard. It was introduced in the UK in late 2007, and was introduced in North America in 2008.</p>
      <p>In the current system coaches can progress from Levels 1 through 4. On this page these coaches are identified as "Level 1 Coach", "Level 2 Coach", etc. Under the old coaching system, coaches could progress from Levels 1 through 5. "BCU" precedes the award level displayed for these coaches, i.e. "BCU Level 1 Coach", "BCU Level 2 Coach", etc. British Canoeing continues to recognize coaches with BCU coaching qualifications, i.e. coaches that are not updated to the current coaching system.</p>
      <p>Another common area of confusion is between the Coaching, Star and Leader award systems. For example, there is no such thing as a "3 Star Coach". The correct term would either be a 3 Star paddler or a Level 3 Coach.
       <ul>
         <li>Star awards are tests of personal skills, and are not coaching awards or leader awards. However, they are prerequisites for coaching awards (e.g. you need a 2 Star award before you can train to be a Level 1 Coach, a 3 Star award before you can train to be a Level 2 Coach, etc.).</li>
         <li>Leader awards are not coaching awards either, but provide leadership training in sheltered or advanced water environments, and continue the refinement of personal skills.</li>         
       </ul>
