        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <span class="section" id="pna">
          <h3>What is PNA?</h3>
          <p>Paddlesports North America (PNA) was formed in 2013 to provide access to British Canoeing (formerly known as the British Canoe Union or BCU) paddler awards and coaching certifications in North America.</p>
          <p>PNA emphasizes paddler proficiency and safety as well as environmental awareness while promoting broader participation in paddlesports, including canoe, kayak and stand up paddleboard.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="bcu">
          <h3>What is British Canoeing?</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.bcu.org.uk/">British Canoeing</a> (formerly known as the British Canoe Union, or BCU) is the most established, geographically and technically diverse paddlesport organization in the world. British Canoeing supports the development of paddlesport primarily in the United Kingdom but has a considerable worldwide presence and impact. British Canoeing has members worldwide, active in all paddle sport disciplines, both recreational and competitive, at all levels, from beginner to World/Olympic Champion. British Canoeing performance awards and coaching certifications are recognized worldwide for their rigor and consistency, and are the gold standard by which other programs are measured.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="bcu-coach">
          <h3>Why should I choose training from a British Canoeing-certified coach?</h3>
          <p>All British Canoeing coaches have been trained and assessed to an exceptionally high and uniform standard and are required to revalidate their certification through continued professional development. This means you get the highest quality and most up-to-date training from a network of coaches who are highly regarded worldwide, and can draw on an unprecedented body of knowledge covering all forms and levels of paddlesport and performance coaching.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="star-awards">
	  <h3>What are Star Awards?</h3>
	    <p>The British Canoeing Star Awards are designed for paddlers aged 16 and over.</p>
	    <p>Star awards signify specific paddling and safety skills at different levels and in various craft. These awards provide a way to track your own progress as a paddler, and give others a reliable indication of your preparedness for trips and further trainings. 1 and 2 star awards encourage paddlers to experience the various types of paddlesport available. Paddlers then 'specialize' in particular disciplines in the 3 Star Award. The focus of the 1, 2 and 3 star awards is developing personal skills and gaining independence.</p>
	    <p>The terms &quot;beginner,&quot; &quot;intermediate,&quot; &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;expert&quot; are highly subjective when applied to paddlers. As a result, paddlers can get into frustrating or potentially dangerous circumstances when they self-assess with these terms. The British Canoeing star award program offers a reliable gauge of a paddler&apos;s physical and mental performance on the water in specific conditions. Star awards also allow paddlers to plan and assess their personal paddling achievements and goals.</p>
	    <p>It is not essential to progress directly through the awards, i.e. paddlers do not need to hold the lower award before progressing.</p>
	</span>
	
	<span class="section" id="leader-awards">
	  <h3>What are Leader Awards?</h3>
	    <p>Leadership training offered by British Canoeing is embedded into the Paddlesport Leader Award. As well as developing personal skills, these awards provide basic leadership training in the sheltered water environment.</p>
	    <p>The Paddlesport Leader is aimed at paddlers taking on formal leadership responsibilities in benign, sheltered water environments, and aims to support Leaders to run safe, quality, enjoyable trips based on their group’s needs and aspirations.</p>
	    <p>Moderate Water Leader Awards are discipline specific awards that provide basic leadership training as well as developing personal skills in a moderate water environment. The disciplines include White Water Kayak, White Water OC1, Canoe Leader, Sea Kayak Leader and Surf Kayak Leader.</p>
	    <p>Advanced Water Leader Awards are discipline specific awards that aim to develop advanced personal skills and provide basic leadership training in an advanced water environment. The disciplines include Advanced White Water Kayak, Advanced White Water OC1, Advanced Canoe Leader, Advanced Sea Kayak Leader and Advanced Surf Kayak Leader.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="ltpd">
          <h3>What is Long Term Paddler Development (LTPD)?</h3>
          <p>LTPD is a logical progression that supports paddlers throughout their paddling careers. It enables paddlers to progress by providing the right challenges and opportunities every step of the way as part of a clear and agreed-upon vision and strategy. LTPD is based on the Long Term Athlete Development model; it was developed for British Canoeing by Istvan Balyi, Ph.D., acknowledged worldwide as the expert in long-term athlete development. This is just one of many examples of how British Canoeing brings current scientific thinking and practices to paddlesport.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="elite-athletes">
          <h3>Is British Canoeing focused on elite athletes?</h3>
          <p>British Canoeing offers awards and certification up to a highly advanced level, but places equal importance on developing paddlers at the beginner level. British Canoeing encourages all paddlers to develop appropriate skills and knowledge for their paddling environment and aspirations.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="section" id="become-a-coach">
          <h3>Should I become a British Canoeing Coach?</h3>
          <p>If you are interested in developing paddling skills in others, value working within a culture of best practices and continuous development within the most widespread and diverse paddlesport organization in the world, then <strong>YES</strong>.</p>

          <p>I began my paddling life as a whitewater boater in New England in 1981.  I took up sea kayaking as a way to stay in shape for the relatively short whitewater season.  After progressing through the <a href="http://www.americancanoe.org/" target="_blalnk">American Canoe Association (ACA)</a> instructor program in whitewater kayak, canoe, C-1 and sea kayak, I was still looking for additional challenges and for ways to continue to develop as a paddler and coach and that's when British Canoeing entered the scene.  In 1995 Nigel Dennis came to Rhode Island to run a variety or courses and I jumped on all of them.  I have been actively involved with British Canoeing ever since, including holding the position of  Midwest Regional Coaching Officer and member of the BCUNA Interim Board of Directors.  What I bring to the PNA Board is a depth and breadth of experience in both the ACA and British Canoeing systems, an 18 year history of involvement with British Canoeing and over 30 years of multi-discipline coaching.  British Canoeing has had a profoundly positive influence on my development as a paddler and coach and I want to help the organization to grow in the States so more paddlers can benefit from all it has to offer.</p>
