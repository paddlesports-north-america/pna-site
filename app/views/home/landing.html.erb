            <h2>PNA/BC Annual Orientation/Moderation Event</h2>
            <p>Dates: January 21-25, 2018</p>
            <p>Location: Charleston Parks and Recreation, James Island County Park, Charleston, SC 29412</p>
            <p>PNA is excited to announce the first of its kind Coach Orientation and Moderation event to happen in North America. This is an exciting time as PNA is finally on track to conform to the standards of all BC Home Nations. This event is designed to orient new providers to deliver the new Coach Award (old Level 2), orient new providers to deliver the new Paddlesport Leader Award, and orient new providers to deliver the Foundation Safety and Rescue Training course.</p>
            <p>As well, Current Leadership Providers (old 4 and 5 Star) are required to participate in a moderation event prior to December 31, 2018 to assure everyone agrees as to the standards that these courses need to be trained and assessed. Current Foundation Safety and Rescue Training (FSRT) Providers need to be moderated for the same reasons, again before December 31, 2018.</p>
            <p>PNA&#39s Coaching Group has identified a need for these events to take place and has scheduled an event to take place when BC Trainers are available and in a location that has the necessary infrastructure to assure the tradition of a PNA/BC annual orientation/moderation event starts off the best possible.</p>
            <h3>Schedule of Events and Description</h3>
            <p>Jan 21: Moderate Water Leader Provider Moderation- this is a one day event for current 4 and 5 Star Providers. Maximum of 6 participants per trainer. *Maximum 12 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 22-23: An orientation to begin the process of becoming a Provider for the new Coach Award. This is a two-day event. Maximum 12 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 24: Paddlesport Leader Provider Moderation- this is a one day event. Maximum of 8 participants per trainer. *Maximum 16 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 25: FSRT Moderation/Orientation- this is a one day event. Maximum of 8 participants per trainer. This will be run as both an orientation and moderation simultaneously. *Maximum 16 participants.</p>
            <p>Cost for the training is $150/day. Participants will be responsible for their own lodging costs (PNA will be reserving cabins at the Park), meals, transportation to Charleston, and boat rental, if necessary.</p>

	    <h2>British Canoeing Coach Award (New Level 2)</h2>
	    <p>British Canoeing will launch its Coach Award in January 2018, replacing the Level 2 coach award, as well as rebrand the Level 1, 3 and 4 coaching awards. The restructured Coach Award has been designed to ensure current research is reflected as well as provide the learner with direct entry opportunities that are relevant to their discipline. British Canoeing has listened to the feedback received and reviews and, as such, we are replacing the portfolio and workbook requirements with interactive eLearning to support the learning and development of the coach.</p>
	    <p>The Coach Award will also encompass the existing Moderate Water and Advanced Water Endorsements, as well as competition coach pathways, providing consistency and standardization across all disciplines at this level.</p>

	    <h3>New Coach Level 2 Tutor/Assessor Application</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/d58RZ53Xgfis8vdk2" target="_blank">Tutor/Assessor Application</a></p>
	    <p>PNA will begin the process of provider orientation training for the new award early in 2018. Details of a PNA Orientation/Moderation event to be held in January 2018 are still being developed and should be available by September 1, 2017. Deadline for applications is September 5, 2017 and invitations to attend the orientation will be extended by September 19, 2017. Consideration will be based on current experience, as well as the intention to develop a mentor/mentee relationship allowing less experienced providers to work alongside more experienced ones to gain valuable guidance while assuring a robust workforce. While we are aware that not everyone&#39s needs or wants will be satisfied by this process, the need for new providers will be reviewed annually and future orientations will be based on continued support of a growing workforce. Questions about prerequisites should be addressed to the PNA Administrator. All other questions should be addressed to the <a href="mailto:coaching@paddlesportsnorthamerica.org" target="_blank">PNA Coaching Group</a></p>

            <h2>Thank you!</h2>

            <p>We are deeply indebted to Bill Lozano who volunteered his time as the administrator of the BCUNA for the past 13 years. Bill tirelessly handled the paperwork and kept the database for everyone who participated in BCU programming in North America during this period. He worked with several BCU coaches to establish PNA, and helped to broker agreements with British Canoeing to establish PNA as an Affiliate Organization and Delivery Center. He continues to serve as our liaison to British Canoeing. </p>


            <p>Thanks, too, to Mike Devlin, British Canoeing Director of Coaching, for being the chief liaison between PNA and British Canoeing.  Mike has been our guide, helping us navigate through the process of creating the very first Affiliate Organization outside of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>We would also like to thank our founding sponsors for their generous support, which covered the expenses incurred in establishing PNA: <a href="http://www.seacliffkayakers.com/" target="_blank">John Carmody of Sea Cliff Kayakers</a>, <a href="http://wernerpaddles.com" target="_blank">Werner Paddles</a>, <a href="http://www.phseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">P&amp;H/Pyranha</a>, <a href="http://seakayakinguk.com" target="_blank">Sea Kayaking UK</a>, <a href="http://www.valleyseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">Valley Sea Kayaks</a> and <a href="http://www.atlantickayaktours.com/" target="_blank">Atlantic Kayak Tours</a>.</p>
