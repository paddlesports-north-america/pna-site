            <h2>Thank you!</h2>

            <p>We are deeply indebted to Bill Lozano who volunteered his time as the administrator of the BCUNA for the past 13 years. Bill tirelessly handled the paperwork and kept the database for everyone who participated in BCU programming in North America during this period. He worked with several BCU coaches to establish PNA, and helped to broker agreements with British Canoeing to establish PNA as an Affiliate Organization and Delivery Center. He continues to serve as our liaison to British Canoeing. </p>


            <p>Thanks, too, to Mike Devlin, British Canoeing Director of Coaching, for being the chief liaison between PNA and British Canoeing.  Mike has been our guide, helping us navigate through the process of creating the very first Affiliate Organization outside of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>We would also like to thank our founding sponsors for their generous support, which covered the expenses incurred in establishing PNA: <a href="http://www.seacliffkayakers.com/" target="_blank">John Carmody of Sea Cliff Kayakers</a>, <a href="http://wernerpaddles.com" target="_blank">Werner Paddles</a>, <a href="http://www.phseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">P&amp;H/Pyranha</a>, <a href="http://seakayakinguk.com" target="_blank">Sea Kayaking UK</a>, <a href="http://www.valleyseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">Valley Sea Kayaks</a> and <a href="http://www.atlantickayaktours.com/" target="_blank">Atlantic Kayak Tours</a>.</p>
