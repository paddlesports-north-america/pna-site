          <h2>Update on PNA Bylaws Changes</h2>
          <p dir="ltr">Our previous newsletter shared three proposed bylaws changes. Upon further review of the bylaws, the board found additional changes that need to be made to reflect some of the realities of how we can efficiently function as a delivery center. This will be a multi-step process, beginning with this notification to members.<br>
            <br>
            Our bylaws were written and approved by NYCON (New York Council of Non Profits, Inc.) when we were founded. Below are proposed changes. We have included the relevant text from the bylaws and we have struck through the text we are proposing to change. Our proposed language is in red ink. &nbsp;We have also added a short explanation of why each change is necessary.<br>
            <br>
            Please consider the five proposed changes below and send any comments to the PNA Administrator at <a href="mailto:info@paddlesportsnorthamerica.org?subject=Comments%20on%20bylaws" target="_blank" style="color: #24b3e3;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">info@paddlesportsnorthamerica.or</a>g by November 19 so that the board can review all comments from current PNA members before voting. After that, members will vote on the board-approved changes.<br>
            <br>
            1. <strong>Change all references to British Canoe Union and BCU</strong> to British Canoeing and BC. (This reflects the organization&rsquo;s current name and acronym.)<br>
            <br>
            <span>2. </span><strong>Article 7: Nomination of Directors</strong><br>
            <span>The nominating committee will consist of a chair and at least two other members. </span><strike>It will be elected during the annual meeting of the board from a slate presented by the Executive Committee.</strike> <span style="color:#FF0000">The board will appoint a nominating committee whose role is to publicize the board member criteria, solicit nominations and short biographical statements, and&nbsp; present the names and bios to the board. The board will carry out the election during the two weeks leading up to the annual meeting.</span> The nominating committee will elect its own chair. The nominating committee shall make every effort to seek out qualified candidates to ensure, as much as possible, that the Board comprises a diverse representation of PNA membership. <strike>The Nominating Committee will can function during the entire year in seeking and recommending candidates for positions on the Board or as Officers. The Nominating Committee will present recommendations to the board regarding any interim vacancy on the Board, or in any Officer&#39;s position, that may occur. The Board will consider the nominations of the Nominating Committee and any other nominee recommended by Board members. The Nominating Committee is responsible to contact Directors absent from two consecutive Board meetings to ascertain whether circumstances prevent their further service from on the Board and to recommend to the Board whether such Directors should be removed from the Board.</strike><br>
            <br>
            <strong><span>Why are we seeking this change?</span></strong><br>
            <span>This provides clarity about our existing process.</span><br>
            <span>Interim vacancies are addressed by </span>Article 6.6 and 6.7<br>
            <span>Board absences are addressed in the </span>PNA Board Member Attendance Policy. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            3. <strong>Change all references to Regional Coaching Offices or RCOs</strong> to Regional Representatives. (This reflects current terminology.)<br>
            <br>
            <strong>4. Section 5.1. Annual Meeting</strong><br>
            The annual meeting of PNA membership for such business as may properly come before it shall be held <strike>no earlier than the first week of October and not later than the last week in November of each year</strike> i<span style="color:#FF0000">n the first quarter of the year </span>at the time and place to be decided by the Board of Directors. Notice of the annual meeting and all other meetings of the members shall be via PNA website at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such meeting. Five (5) shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. <strike>In the event a quorum is not present at the meeting, the election shall be submitted to a vote of the general membership.</strike><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Why are we seeking this change?</strong><br>
            A first quarter meeting is a better&nbsp;fit with the industry cycle.<br>
            Most voting is done electronically in advance of the annual meeting.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>5. Section 6.6. Terms of Office</strong><br>
            The Board of Directors shall enter into their term of office <strike>seven days after the close of the election.</strike> <span style="color:#FF0000">upon the beginning of the calendar year following their election</span>. Directors and Officers shall hold office for two years and may succeed in that office until a successor is elected and qualified, unless having earlier lost the status of a Director. <span style="color:#FF0000">In order to stagger terms, at the 2018 election, the top vote-getter will get to choose a one-year or two-year term, the second highest vote-getter will choose next and so on until half the newly elected directors have one-year terms and half have two-year terms. </span>All board members can nominate themselves for reelection in subsequent years, and all subsequent elections will be for two-year terms. &nbsp;In the event of the resignation or removal of any Board member, the Board has the power to fill vacancies in the Board and its officers for the remainder unexpired terms and act for its interests in any way not inconsistent with these Bylaws. The immediate past President shall serve in an advisory capacity for an additional one-year term upon expiration of her/his term of office if it coincides with the expiration of her/his term on the Board. The immediate Past-Chair shall serve as an adviser to the current Chair.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Why are we seeking this change?</strong><br>
            To reflect the date of the annual meeting and elections.<br>

            <h2>Temporary Suspension of Delivery Center Status</h2>

            <p>It is with regret that we report that PNA&rsquo;s status as a delivery center for British Canoeing has been temporarily suspended, effective Dec. 18, 2017. This suspension came after a recent review by British Canoeing international of our progress over the past 18 months toward meeting all of the criteria necessary for being a British Canoeing delivery center. The current PNA board is diligently working to meet the goals needed to be reinstated as soon as possible.<br>
              <br>
              British Canoeing is fully committed to our regaining delivery center status, as are we. We will update you on our progress, but until then all of the following will have to go through British Canoeing International, not PNA:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Course authorizations</li>
              <li>Learner Registrations</li>
              <li>Certifications</li>
            </ul>

            <p>PNA will be sending out a separate letter to all PNA Providers outlining this temporary policy.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU?</strong><br>
              If your PNA membership is expired, you can renew with PNA up until December 17, 2017 and British Canoeing will honor that membership through its expiration date. After that date you will have to <a href="https://mcd.britishcanoeing.org.uk/MCD/Online/Membership/Index?organisationId=1746&amp;layout=Online" target="_blank" style="color: #24b3e3;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">join British Canoeing</a>.<br>
              <br>
              If you join British Canoeing during this suspension time, PNA will honor this membership and transfer you back to PNA when we regain our delivery center status.<br>
              <br>
              If you have questions or concerns, please contact our administrator, Scott Fairty, at <a href="mailto:info@paddlesportsnorthamerica.org?subject=Question%20about%20delivery%20center%20status" target="_blank" style="color: #24b3e3;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">info@paddlesportsnorthamerica.org</a>.</p>

            <h2>PNA/BC Annual Orientation/Moderation Event</h2>
            <p>Dates: January 21-25, 2018</p>
            <p>Location: Charleston Parks and Recreation, James Island County Park, Charleston, SC 29412</p>
            <p>PNA is excited to announce the first of its kind Coach Orientation and Moderation event to happen in North America. This is an exciting time as PNA is finally on track to conform to the standards of all BC Home Nations. This event is designed to orient new providers to deliver the new Coach Award (old Level 2), orient new providers to deliver the new Paddlesport Leader Award, and orient new providers to deliver the Foundation Safety and Rescue Training course.</p>
            <p>As well, Current Leadership Providers (old 4 and 5 Star) are required to participate in a moderation event prior to December 31, 2018 to assure everyone agrees as to the standards that these courses need to be trained and assessed. Current Foundation Safety and Rescue Training (FSRT) Providers need to be moderated for the same reasons, again before December 31, 2018.</p>
            <p>PNA&#39s Coaching Group has identified a need for these events to take place and has scheduled an event to take place when BC Trainers are available and in a location that has the necessary infrastructure to assure the tradition of a PNA/BC annual orientation/moderation event starts off the best possible.</p>
            <h3>Schedule of Events and Description</h3>
            <p>Jan 21: Moderate Water Leader Provider Moderation- this is a one day event for current 4 and 5 Star Providers. Maximum of 6 participants per trainer. *Maximum 12 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 22-23: An orientation to begin the process of becoming a Provider for the new Coach Award. This is a two-day event. Maximum 12 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 24: Paddlesport Leader Provider Moderation- this is a one day event. Maximum of 8 participants per trainer. *Maximum 16 participants.</p>
            <p>Jan 25: FSRT Moderation/Orientation- this is a one day event. Maximum of 8 participants per trainer. This will be run as both an orientation and moderation simultaneously. *Maximum 16 participants.</p>
            <p>Cost for the training is $150/day. Participants will be responsible for their own lodging costs (PNA will be reserving cabins at the Park), meals, transportation to Charleston, and boat rental, if necessary.</p>
            <p>To participate in either the Coach Provider orientation or the Paddlesport Leader Provider orientation there is an application process. Please see below for application details.</p>

	    <h2>British Canoeing Coach Award (New Level 2)</h2>
	    <p>British Canoeing will launch its Coach Award in January 2018, replacing the Level 2 coach award, as well as rebrand the Level 1, 3 and 4 coaching awards. The restructured Coach Award has been designed to ensure current research is reflected as well as provide the learner with direct entry opportunities that are relevant to their discipline. British Canoeing has listened to the feedback received and reviews and, as such, we are replacing the portfolio and workbook requirements with interactive eLearning to support the learning and development of the coach.</p>
	    <p>The Coach Award will also encompass the existing Moderate Water and Advanced Water Endorsements, as well as competition coach pathways, providing consistency and standardization across all disciplines at this level.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/d58RZ53Xgfis8vdk2" target="_blank">Tutor/Assessor Application</a></p>
	    <p>PNA will begin the process of provider orientation training for the new award early in 2018. Details of a PNA Orientation/Moderation event to be held in January 2018 are still being developed and should be available by September 1, 2017. Deadline for applications is September 5, 2017 and invitations to attend the orientation will be extended by September 19, 2017. Consideration will be based on current experience, as well as the intention to develop a mentor/mentee relationship allowing less experienced providers to work alongside more experienced ones to gain valuable guidance while assuring a robust workforce. While we are aware that not everyone&#39s needs or wants will be satisfied by this process, the need for new providers will be reviewed annually and future orientations will be based on continued support of a growing workforce. Questions about prerequisites should be addressed to the PNA Administrator. All other questions should be addressed to the <a href="mailto:coaching@paddlesportsnorthamerica.org" target="_blank">PNA Coaching Group</a></p>

            <h2>Thank you!</h2>

            <p>We are deeply indebted to Bill Lozano who volunteered his time as the administrator of the BCUNA for the past 13 years. Bill tirelessly handled the paperwork and kept the database for everyone who participated in BCU programming in North America during this period. He worked with several BCU coaches to establish PNA, and helped to broker agreements with British Canoeing to establish PNA as an Affiliate Organization and Delivery Center. He continues to serve as our liaison to British Canoeing. </p>


            <p>Thanks, too, to Mike Devlin, British Canoeing Director of Coaching, for being the chief liaison between PNA and British Canoeing.  Mike has been our guide, helping us navigate through the process of creating the very first Affiliate Organization outside of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>We would also like to thank our founding sponsors for their generous support, which covered the expenses incurred in establishing PNA: <a href="http://www.seacliffkayakers.com/" target="_blank">John Carmody of Sea Cliff Kayakers</a>, <a href="http://wernerpaddles.com" target="_blank">Werner Paddles</a>, <a href="http://www.phseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">P&amp;H/Pyranha</a>, <a href="http://seakayakinguk.com" target="_blank">Sea Kayaking UK</a>, <a href="http://www.valleyseakayaks.com/" target="_blank">Valley Sea Kayaks</a> and <a href="http://www.atlantickayaktours.com/" target="_blank">Atlantic Kayak Tours</a>.</p>
